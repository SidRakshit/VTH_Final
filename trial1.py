            Batman has an insanely busy schedule.

            Then there are those regular Justice League meetings and the time he has to spend on his regular workouts and training sessions with the latest Robin. 
            Even when heâ€™s not Batman, he has to keep up appearances as Bruce Wayne by dating supermodels (poor guy).
